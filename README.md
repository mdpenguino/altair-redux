# Altair-Redux


Recreation of [Altair](https://github.com/mdpenguino/altair), using Electron. Altair will be an anime tracker with planned support, primarily MyAnimeList, but hopefully Kitsu and AniList further down the line.
## Overview
Altair-redux or stylised as **AltaiR** is a recreation of [Altair](https://github.com/mdpenguino/altair), using Electron. AltaiR will be an anime tracker with planned support, primarily for MyAnimeList, but hopefully Kitsu and AniList will be implemented further down the line.


## Versioning
Whenever a significant milestone of the AltaiR project is reached (these milestones will be based off of development goals from the trello board) it will be updated. Releases will be X.0.0, minor development changes will be 0.X.0, bug fix versions or minor tweaks will use 0.0.X for their versioning.

So, to summarise;
```
X.0.0    Release version
0.X.0    Minor development changes
0.0.X    Tweaks/fixes
```
